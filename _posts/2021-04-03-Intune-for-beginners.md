## Steps for first configuration

### DNS configuration in Office Admin Panel

`Note: To perform this task you need to have access to DNS Server or host provider.`

**Step 1:** Create DNS entries

| Type | Name  | Value | TTL |
| ---| -- | ---- | ---- |
| CANME | EnterpriseEnrollment.CustomDomainName.com  | EnterpriseEnrollment.manage.microsoft.com | 3600 |
| CANME | EnterpriseRegistration.CustomDomainName.com | EnterpriseRegistration.windows.net | 3600 |

> EnterpriseEnrollment - To simplify enrollment, create a domain name server (DNS) alias (CNAME record type) that redirects enrollment requests to Intune servers. Otherwise, users trying to connect to Intune must enter the Intune server name during enrollment.  
> EnterpriseRegistration - Azure Active Directory has a different CNAME that it uses for device registration for iOS/iPadOS, Android, and Windows devices. Intune conditional access requires devices to be registered, also called "workplace joined".
