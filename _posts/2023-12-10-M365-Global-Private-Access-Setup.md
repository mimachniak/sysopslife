## What is Entra Private Access

Microsoft Entra Private Access provides your users - whether in an office or working remotely - secured access to your private, corporate resources. Microsoft Entra Private Access builds on the capabilities of Microsoft Entra application proxy and extends access to any private resource, port, and protocol.  

Remote users can connect to private apps across hybrid and multicloud environments, private networks, and data centers from any device and network without requiring a VPN. The service offers per-app adaptive access based on Conditional Access policies, for more granular security than a VPN.  

### Key features

* Quick Access: Zero Trust based access to a range of IP addresses and/or FQDNs without requiring a legacy VPN.
* Per-app access for TCP apps (UDP support in development).
* Modernize legacy app authentication with deep Conditional Access integration.
* Provide a seamless end-user experience by acquiring network traffic from the desktop client and deploying side-by-side with your existing third-party SSE solutions.
