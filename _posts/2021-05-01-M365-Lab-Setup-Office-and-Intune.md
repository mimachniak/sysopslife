## Why I write this article

Hi, I wrote this article to help with creation of first Microsoft 365 tenant that can be convert to production environment. In this article I will highlight some point to avoid mistake that I have made in past, all information are base on my experience. 

## Prerequisites 

Before we begin with this you will need to consider few things and answer questions:  

+ Is this will be LAB environment and will not be converted to production.
  + LAB Only: Tenant name suppose not be connected to organization name, once used tenant name cannot be reused or changed. **Example:** demo{Random Numbers} 
  + LAB Only: Use the highest licenses like E5 to check all settings and dependencies for compare.
  + LAB Only: Don't use production custom domains, domain can be assigned only to one **Tenant**.
  + LAB Only: Location of Tenant don't need to be compliance with organization location.
+ Is this PoC Pilot environment that will be converted to production.
  + PoC: Tenant name suppose not be connected to organization name, once used tenant name cannot be reused or changed. **Example:** poc{Random Numbers} 
  + PoC: Use the highest licenses like E5 to check all settings and dependencies for compare.
  + PoC: Collect user case that you like to present.
  + PoC: Don't use production custom domains, domain can be assigned only to one **Tenant**.
  + PoC: Location of Tenant need to be compliance with organization location.
+ Is this Pilot environment that will be converted to production.
  + Pilot: Tenant name need to be connected to Organization for adoption propose.
  + Pilot: Tenant name need to be approve by business because will be used as first part of URL in **SharePoint** and **OneDrive**
  + Pilot: Use licenses that match Organization business cases to avoid misconfiguration.
  + Pilot: Don't use production custom domains, to avoid data flow distributions. 
  + Pilot: Location of Tenant need to be compliance with organization location.

--------------------------
## First Azure Active Directory Tenant that will host our data.

Why we need new Azure Active Directory Tenant ?

* New **tenant** will be created because your organization starts testing Microsoft 365.
* New **tenant** will be crated if our organization migrate from on-prem solutions to Microsoft365.
* New **tenant** can be created because our organization need Lab environment and don't like mess up with existing configuration.
* New **tenant** can be created because 2 organizations merge to new one.
* New **tenant** can be created because organization is rebranding.
* New **tenant** name of tenant is not valid by organization.


### What is Tenant ?

 **Tenant** Is isolated dedicated space for our organization and our assets. The Tenant is the container for items of your Organization such as users, domains, subscriptions, devices, permissions, Office 365 Data. Tenant is fundamental for all services in Microsoft Cloud.

**Example** of data isolation in Microsoft tenant

![](/assets/images/M365-Lab/M365-Lab-Tenant.png)


Microsoft for make simple onboarding organization to Office365 or Azure, sometimes provision tenant automatically without passing any information, as the name of tenant is using e-mail address and location is take form our accounts.   
**Example** of this scenario when tenant can be create without any prompt. 
 - MSDN Subscriptions.
 - Azure free trial Subscriptions.  

 **LAB** Tenant and won't be used for production so in this case name and location doesnâ€™t matter, but if we will create **PoC** or **Pilot** tenant that in feature can be converted to production we have to be more aware when data will be stored and what name is used.  

>
> **Notice:** Tenant **"Location"** have impact on services that we can use in Office 365, for example **Phone Systems**

### Create Azure Active Directory Tenant

**Step 1:** Open a browser in InPrivate session, and navigate in browser to [https://account.azure.com/organization/](https://account.azure.com/organization/) 

![](/assets/images/M365-Lab/M365-Tenant-1.png)

**Step 2:** Fill up date of your organization

**Country** - Location of tenant and Datacenter region, for data processing.
**Name and Surname** - use for display on first account
**Contact Number** - for presales and support.
**Organization Name** - Display name of organization it will be used in adoption process, can be change latter.
**Size** - information only.

**Step 3:** Tenant creation data

**Account ID** - Will be used to create first user in our **tenant**.  
>
> **Best practice:** As Account ID plase don't use standard names like: Administrator, admin. 
> **Best practice:** Use first account to create your admin account and assign rights.
>
**Domain Name** - Will be used to create default domain in our **tenant**, cannot be change and will be used to create URL's for **SharePoint** and **OneDrive**.

## Custom domain for LAB purpose without paying (LAB / PoC)

### How to obtain free custom domain name for M365 Tenant?

Domains can be bough on any DNS provider on your country or region, choosing domains is only depending on business needs. But for LAB or PoC propose some time is good to have dedicated domain for testing and good representation of business case, but there is non free domain. 

But with help of community and with credentials for  "Gerenios Ltd" we can generated free domain dedicated for Office365 with names:

> **Notice:** Those domains are only LAB and POC purpose, don't use them for production.

* MyO365.net

## Activate trial license

Microsoft allow to activate **once** peer tenant trial license for different products on licenses level, trial licenses are activate for 30 days and sometime can be extended to another 30 days. 
When we prepare pre-production tenant we can add trial license and start PoC without paying any money and onboard pilot users for testing. 

> **Trial expired:**
>
> * We cannot on the same tenant launch another trial for the same version of product and license level.
> * Content will be stored for 30 days, of license won't be active content will be deleted.
> * Adding production licenses we don't have to re assign them to users if are in the same license level. Trail will expired production licenses will be active. **Example:** Trial license was M365 E5 and production bought by organization > are M365 E5 as well.
>  

### Microsoft 365

Activating Microsoft 365 trial license, if your business is using Office 365 you can active separately. Chose license level and bundle to you business requirements, in LAB environment I will use the highes that is E5.

$PasswordProfile.Password = "Your test Users passwords"

# Create example users

New-AzureADUser -DisplayName "John Doe" -UserPrincipalName John.Doe$userDomain -MailNickName "JohnDoe" -AccountEnabled $true -PasswordProfile $PasswordProfile
New-AzureADUser -DisplayName "Jane Doe" -UserPrincipalName Jane.Doe$userDomain -MailNickName "JaneDoe" -AccountEnabled $true -PasswordProfile $PasswordProfile
