## Why I write this article

Hi I wrote this article to help other start with Office 365 and Intune, without intervention on existing tenant or start as green filed for company to begin. I hope this guide we help you to avoid misconfiguration.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin with this you will need to consider few things:  

- Is this will be LAB environment and won't be converted to production.
- Is this PoC or Pilot environment that will be converted to production.

Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
